This document introduce the implement and usage of our toy compiler for MyLang.

The program compiler_i3 in root directory is an executable program which will
take you to have a deep look at the 4 steps of compiling, including
lexical-analyze, grammer-tree-building, semantic-check and code-generate.

The file folder named Lex contains the details of lexical analysis, the
Grammer folder includes the implement of grammer-tree for MyLang. Then we make
the semantic checking come true in Semantic file folder. After finishing our
job, we write some test cases to show the features of MyLang. By the way, our
front-end interface is implemented by some QT components whose details are
in the folder called UIfile.

You can use the compiler by typing ./compiler_i3 in the root directory, or you
will go into the Semantic file and type make and ./dragon which is the
command-version compiler of MyLang.
